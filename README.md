Mini-Games for CODE University Module SE01

## Getting Started

I created for every game a own page
Go to lib -> main -> games and choose the game you want.

## How to test the Games

you can compile the games for iOS / Android / Web.
Don't forget to install flutter.

Android:
install adb tools
(run "flutter pub get")
run "flutter run"


Web
run "flutter run -d web-server"
